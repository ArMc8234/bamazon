# bamzon
node.js and mySql exercise

The bamazon db allows the user to connect to the database to see the available items in list form, then click an item to buy from a choice array.  Next, the user can state how items they want.  If there aren't enough in stock, they will be notified of the amount in stock and given the opportunity to order again.  The amount ordered will be multiplied by the unit price and the total cost will be displayed.
